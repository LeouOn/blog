Yune Leou-On

PhD Student Political Science (Expected Graduation 2023) University of Oregon
MA Asia Pacific Studies (2015) University of San Francisco
BA Natural Sciences & Mathematics | Social Sciences (2014) Thomas Edison State University

First year PhD Student at the University of Oregon. My goal is to become a competent Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with the substantive expertise in applying my skills to understanding social and political phenomena. I am most interested in getting involved in academia as either as a social sciences Professor in Information Science or a data-driven Professor of Political Science. Secondarily I am interested in working for an NGO or thinktank as long as I can get involved in research that I am passionate about.
