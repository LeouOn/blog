# Afflictive Emotions Quiz

My friend Matt Gola had this idea to create a quiz that would diagnose which of the 6 root and 22 subsidiary kleshas (mental afflictions) a user suffered from and give some advice in accordance with the Dharma. I thought that this was a great idea since it could be a great application of machine learning to psychological health and as far as we know, nothing like this has ever been done before. If the test is successfully created, we can add a test constituting the 11 virtuous mental factors as well.
